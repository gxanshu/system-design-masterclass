# Framework for system design

## Step 1: Decide Requirements
there are 2 types of requirements
### Functional
what the end functionality we need in our app. like in YouTube, able to upload the video and able to stream the video

### Non Functional
requirements like scaliblity, reliablity etc. like the user should be able to upload video faster not in one hour and the user video stream does not stop every 10 second.

## Step 2: Capacity Estimation
try to find out an assumption on how much capacity your app gonna need

### DAU/MAU
how many daily active and monthly active users we gonna have

### Throughput
how many requests we gonna get per second.
for example if 100M DAU and each making 100 Request per second then its (100M x 100) requests per second

### Storage/Memory
how much storage and memory your system gonna take

### Network/Bandwidth
how much bandwidth your system gonna take.

## Step 3: API Design
design basic API like how many endpoints you gonna need what will be there location, request body and response

### Step 4: High Level Design
create a raw diagram on how the design gonna look like

### Step 5: deep dive
extand your design as per Function and Non-Functional requirements
